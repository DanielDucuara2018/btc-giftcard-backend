# BTC Gift Card Service - Implementation Roadmap

**Last Updated:** July 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 partially complete, Phase 3-4 core done — HTTP API + monitor_tx worker next

---

## Vision

> **From gift card to payment instrument.** We're not just building a BTC gift card — we're building a Lightning-native payment network. Today: buy a card, redeem BTC. Tomorrow: spend your card balance directly at merchants, online stores, and point-of-sale terminals — all powered by Lightning Network instant payments.

**Short-term (Months 1-4):** Gift card service with Lightning-first redemption  
**Medium-term (Months 5-8):** Direct merchant payments — spend card balance without redemption  
**Long-term (Year 2+):** Payment ecosystem — virtual cards, NFC payments, merchant network

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan to transform our MVP into a production-ready, cost-optimized BTC gift card service that evolves into a **Lightning-powered payment platform**. Key improvements include:

- **Cost Reduction:** €2,485 → €637 per 1000 cards (74% reduction)
- **Profit Increase:** €2,515 → €4,363 per 1000 cards (73% increase)
- **Processing Speed:** 30-60 minutes → 1 second (Lightning Network)
- **Automation:** Manual processes → Automated reconciliation & funding
- **Future:** Gift cards become spendable at merchants (Lightning payments)

## Current Status (Completed ✅)

### Foundation (original)
- ✅ Exchange price providers (Coinbase, CoinGecko, Bitstamp) — `internal/exchange/`
- ✅ Message queue system (Redis Streams) — `pkg/cache/`, `internal/queue/`
- ✅ Card service with async queue integration — `internal/card/service.go`
- ✅ Documentation: README, API docs, architecture diagrams
- ✅ Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker Compose

### LND Package (47 unit + 7 integration tests)
- ✅ gRPC client with TLS + macaroon auth — `internal/lnd/client.go`
- ✅ Lightning payments (SendPaymentV2 streaming) — `internal/lnd/lightning.go`
- ✅ On-chain transactions (SendCoins, NewAddress, WalletBalance) — `internal/lnd/onchain.go`
- ✅ Treasury queries (ChannelBalance, GetInfo) — `internal/lnd/treasury.go`
- ✅ LND v0.20.1-beta module, Docker container on testnet (neutrino SPV)

### Card Service — Business Logic (`internal/card/service.go`)
- ✅ **CreateCard** with `validateCreateRequest` — currency, amount, email validation
- ✅ **FundCard** — treasury lock + balance check + card activation + revert-on-failure
- ✅ **RedeemCard** — 8-step orchestrator with Lightning + on-chain dual path
- ✅ **GetCardByCode, GetCardBalance, ValidateCardCode** — read-only API methods
- ✅ **GetTreasuryAvailableBalance** — Redis-cached (10s TTL) for API endpoints
- ✅ Treasury distributed locking (Redis SETNX 5s TTL) + per-card locks (10s TTL)
- ✅ `computeTreasuryBalance` — uncached authoritative balance for write paths
- ✅ 14 sentinel errors, string-based enums, `CreateCardFiatCurrency` (USD/EUR)
- ✅ `MonitorTransactionMessage` publishing for on-chain redemptions

### Workers
- ✅ **fund_card worker** — thin adapter delegating to `card.Service.FundCard()`

### Database
- ✅ String-based enums: `CardStatus`, `TransactionType`, `TransactionStatus`
- ✅ Custodial model: no wallet-per-card, cards are balance claims on treasury
- ✅ Redemption fields on transactions table (method, payment_hash, preimage, invoice)
- ✅ CardRepository (Create, GetByCode, GetByID, Update, ListByUserID, GetTotalReservedBalance)
- ✅ TransactionRepository (Create, GetByID, GetByTxHash, ListByCardID, Update)

## Phase 1: MVP Launch (On-Chain) - Weeks 1-2

**Goal:** Launch minimal viable product with on-chain Bitcoin only

### 1.1 Payment Integration - Direct Bank Transfers

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Cost Impact:** €0 vs €250 (Stripe fees for 1000 cards)

### 1.2 Treasury Management - Automated OTC Purchases (Crypto.com)

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Cost Impact:** 0.16% (OTC) vs 3% (fiat onramp)  
**Automation Level:** Fully automatable via Crypto.com Exchange API

- [ ] **Set up Crypto.com Exchange account**
  - Register for Crypto.com Exchange (not the app)
  - Complete business KYC/AML verification
  - Enable API access with HMAC-SHA256 authentication
  - Whitelist treasury wallet address for withdrawals
  - Set up UAT sandbox for testing: `https://uat-api.3ona.co/exchange/v1/`
  - **Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours + KYC waiting time

- [ ] **Create treasury wallet system**
  - Database table: `treasury_wallets`
    - Fields: wallet_type, address, balance_sats, balance_fiat_cents, last_updated
  - Generate on-chain BTC address for receiving from OTC
  - Encrypt seed/private key with AES-256-GCM
  - Store encrypted key in secure location (consider HSM for production)
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

- [x] **Implement balance tracking** ✅ Done
  - `computeTreasuryBalance()` — queries LND (on-chain + channel) minus reserved card balances
  - `GetTreasuryAvailableBalance()` — Redis-cached (10s TTL) for API endpoints
  - `AcquireTreasuryLock()` / `ReleaseTreasuryLock()` — Redis SETNX distributed lock (5s TTL)
  - `InvalidateTreasuryCache()` — bust cache after mutations
  - Per-card Redis lock `card:lock:{code}` (10s TTL) for concurrent redemption safety

- [ ] **Implement automated OTC purchase flow (Crypto.com OTC 2.0 API)**
  - Create `internal/treasury/otc_provider.go`
  - **Step 1 - Fiat deposit to Crypto.com (via Bank API):**
    - Use bank API (Qonto/Revolut/Wise) to send SEPA wire to Crypto.com fiat wallet
    - Crypto.com provides SEPA deposit details via Fiat Wallet API (`openpayd_exchange_sepa`)
    - ⚠️ Fiat deposits CANNOT be initiated via Crypto.com API (must come from bank side)
    - Monitor deposit arrival via `private/user-balance` polling
  - **Step 2 - RFQ (Request for Quote):**
    - `POST private/otc/request-quote` with `{symbol: "BTCEUR", side: "BUY", size: amount}`
    - Response: quote with price, expiry (typically 10 seconds)
  - **Step 3 - Accept deal:**
    - `POST private/otc/request-deal` with `{quote_id: "..."}`
    - BTC credited instantly to exchange wallet
  - **Step 4 - Withdraw BTC to treasury:**
    - `POST private/create-withdrawal` with whitelisted treasury address
    - Monitor withdrawal status
  - **Full cycle time:** ~1-2 business days (SEPA) + instant (OTC buy + withdrawal)
  - **Estimated effort:** 10-12 hours

- [ ] **Implement treasury auto-refill trigger**
  - Monitor treasury balance via `GetTreasuryBalance()`
  - Trigger conditions:
    - Balance < 20% of weekly volume → Normal refill
    - Balance < 10% → Critical refill (immediate)
  - Auto-refill flow:
    1. Calculate refill amount (target: 1 week of expected volume)
    2. Send SEPA wire from bank to Crypto.com (via bank API)
    3. Wait for deposit confirmation (poll Crypto.com balance)
    4. Execute OTC buy (RFQ → Deal)
    5. Withdraw BTC to treasury wallet
  - Slack/email notifications at each step
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

- [ ] **Set up treasury monitoring alerts**
  - Email/Slack alert at 20% balance
  - Critical alert at 10% balance
  - Daily balance summary email
  - Webhook integration with Slack

### 1.3 Worker Implementation - Custodial Funding

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** Skeleton exists, TODOs updated for custodial model

- [x] **Implement `cmd/worker/fund_card/main.go`** ✅ Done
  - Worker is a thin adapter: parse message → fetch price → calculate sats → delegate to `card.Service.FundCard()`
  - `Service.FundCard()` handles: treasury lock → balance check → card activation → tx creation → cache invalidation → revert-on-failure
  - Uses `exchange.PriceProvider` (Coinbase/CoinGecko/Bitstamp) for price fetching
  - String-based enums throughout, per-card distributed locking

- [ ] **Add OTC price source to exchange provider**
  - Add `cryptocom_otc` provider to `internal/exchange/provider.go`
  - Use Crypto.com OTC 2.0 RFQ endpoint for indicative quotes
  - Fallback chain: OTC provider → Coinbase → CoinGecko
  - Cache price for 30 seconds (avoid hitting rate limits)
  - **Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours

### 1.4 Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Integration tests for full card lifecycle**
  - Test: Payment received → Card funded → Transaction confirmed
  - Test: Insufficient treasury balance handling
  - Test: Concurrent card funding (no double-spend)
  - Test: Transaction timeout and retry
  - **Estimated effort:** 8-10 hours

- [ ] **Load testing**
  - Simulate 100 cards/hour
  - Monitor Redis queue performance
  - Check database query performance
  - Identify bottlenecks
  - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

- [ ] **Security audit**

  - Create `internal/payment/bank_provider.go` (interface for multiple banks)
  - **If Qonto (recommended):**
    - OAuth 2.0 authentication
    - Trust Crypto.com as beneficiary → enables fully automated SEPA transfers (no SCA)
    - `POST /v2/external_transfers` for automated payouts to trusted beneficiaries
    - `POST /v2/sepa/bulk_transfers` for batch processing (up to 400 per batch)
    - Idempotency via `X-Qonto-Idempotency-Key` header
    - Instant SEPA by default (fallback to standard above threshold)
    - ⚠️ Transfers >€30,000 require at least one attachment

## Phase 3: Lightning Network Migration - Month 3-4

**Goal:** Reduce transaction costs by 99% and improve speed to <1 second

**Cost Impact:** €500 (on-chain) → €1 (Lightning) per 1000 cards

### 3.1 Lightning Infrastructure Setup

**Priority:** HIGH (if pursuing Lightning)  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete and generating revenue

- [x] **Deploy LND node** ✅ Done
  - Docker container with LND v0.18.4-beta on testnet (neutrino SPV backend)
  - Named volume `lnd_data` for persistence
  - Go module uses `lnd@v0.20.1-beta` with protobuf replace directive
  - Macaroon authentication + TLS configured
  - Config struct: GRPCHost, Port, TLSCertPath, MacaroonPath, Network, PaymentTimeoutSeconds, MaxPaymentFeeSats

- [ ] **Open Lightning channels**
  - Research hub selection (ACINQ, Bitrefill, LNBig)
  - Open channels with high-liquidity hubs
  - Channel size: 0.05-0.1 BTC per channel
  - Total channels: 3-5 for redundancy
  - **Cost:** €20-30 in channel opening fees (one-time)
  - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

- [ ] **Set up channel monitoring**
  - Monitor channel balance (local vs remote)
  - Alert on low outbound liquidity
  - Automated channel rebalancing (loop out if needed)
  - Channel force-close detection
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

### 3.2 Lightning Wallet Integration

- [x] **Replace btcsuite with LND client** ✅ Done
  - Created `internal/lnd/client.go` (gRPC + TLS + macaroon, `LightningClient` interface)
  - `internal/lnd/lightning.go`: `PayInvoice` (SendPaymentV2 streaming), `DecodeInvoice`
  - `internal/lnd/onchain.go`: `SendOnChain`, `NewAddress`, `GetWalletBalance`
  - `internal/lnd/treasury.go`: `GetChannelBalance`, `GetInfo`
  - 47 unit tests + 7 integration tests passing
  - `PaymentResultStatus` enum: Succeeded/Failed/InFlight

- [ ] **Update database schema for custodial model**
  ```sql
  -- Cards are balance claims on treasury. No wallets, no keys, just amounts.
  -- btc_amount_sats tracks remaining balance (decremented on each spend)
  -- Status: created → funding → active → redeemed (when balance = 0)
  -- No redemption_method on cards — each transaction tracks its own method
  
  -- ALREADY DONE: Removed wallet_address, encrypted_priv_key from cards
  -- ALREADY DONE: Added redemption_method, payment_hash, payment_preimage,
  --               lightning_invoice to transactions table
  ```
  - ~~Migration script to remove wallet fields~~ ✅ Done
  - Much simpler and more secure than managing 1000s of private keys
  - **Partial spend model:** Cards can be spent in portions (multiple transactions)
    - Each transaction deducts from `btc_amount_sats`
    - Card stays `active` until balance reaches 0, then becomes `redeemed`
    - Each transaction independently chooses Lightning or on-chain
  - **Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

- [x] **Update CreateCard for custodial model** ✅ Done
  - `CreateCard(ctx, req)` creates card as a balance claim on treasury
  - No Bitcoin transaction, no wallet generation
  - `validateCreateRequest()` validates currency, fiat amount, purchase price, email
  - `CreateCardFiatCurrency` enum (USD/EUR) with `IsValid()` method
  - Card status starts as `Created`, transitions to `Funding` → `Active` via FundCard

### 3.3 Custodial Treasury System

**Architecture:** OTC (on-chain) → Treasury On-Chain Wallet → Lightning Channels (BTC locked) → Users redeem on-demand

**How it works:**
1. **Receive from OTC:** BTC arrives at treasury on-chain address (example: 2 BTC received)
2. **Split Treasury:**
   - **Lightning Channels:** Lock 1.8 BTC (90%) - for Lightning redemptions
   - **Hot Wallet:** Keep 0.2 BTC (10%) on-chain - for on-chain redemptions
3. **Create Cards:** Database entries with balance claims (NO Bitcoin tx, NO individual wallets)
4. **User Redeems (Lightning):** Pay from Lightning channel balance → User's Lightning wallet
5. **User Redeems (On-Chain):** Send from hot wallet → User's on-chain address

**Important:** 
- Cards are custodial - NO individual wallets created per card
- We hold ALL BTC in OUR treasury (Lightning channels + hot wallet)
- Card creation is just accounting - BTC only moves when user redeems
- Lightning channels can ONLY send Lightning payments (that's why we need hot wallet for on-chain)

- [x] **Implement treasury management system** ✅ Done
  - `computeTreasuryBalance()`: LND on-chain wallet + channel balance - reserved card balances
  - `GetTreasuryAvailableBalance()`: Redis-cached (10s TTL) for API reads
  - `AcquireTreasuryLock()` / `ReleaseTreasuryLock()`: Redis SETNX distributed lock (5s TTL)
  - `InvalidateTreasuryCache()`: Cache busting after mutations
  - Formula: Available = (WalletBalance + ChannelBalance) - TotalReservedBalance
  - Hot wallet + Lightning channel split tracked via LND queries
  - **Why both?** Lightning adoption is growing but not universal. Maximize market reach.
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

- [ ] **Automated channel liquidity management**
  - Monitor outbound capacity daily
  - Refill channels from on-chain treasury
  - Use submarine swaps (Lightning Loop) if needed
  - Alert when channels below 20% capacity
  - **Estimated effort:** 8-10 hours

- [ ] **Channel opening automation**
  - Function: `OpenChannel(nodeID, amountSats)`
  - Trigger: When outbound liquidity < 10%
  - Source: On-chain treasury wallet
  - Confirmation: Wait for 3 confirmations before using
  - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

### 3.4 Worker Update - Lightning-First Funding

- [ ] **Update `cmd/worker/fund_card/main.go` for hybrid mode**
  - Check card type: Lightning invoice or on-chain address
  - **Lightning path:**
    - Decode invoice
    - Check invoice expiry
    - Send payment via LND `SendPaymentSync()`
    - Update card status on success (instant)
    - Cost: €0.001, Time: 1 second
  - **On-chain fallback:**
    - Use existing on-chain logic
    - Cost: €0.50, Time: 30-60 minutes
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

- [ ] **Add Lightning payment monitoring**
  - Subscribe to LND payment updates via gRPC stream
  - Handle payment failures (routing, insufficient liquidity)
  - Retry logic: Try 3 times, then fallback to on-chain
  - Log payment routes for optimization
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

### 3.5 Testing Lightning Integration

- [ ] **Testnet validation**
  - Deploy LND on Bitcoin testnet
  - Open channels with testnet faucets
  - Test invoice generation and payment
  - Test failure scenarios (expired invoice, routing failure)
  - **Estimated effort:** 8-10 hours

- [ ] **Mainnet pilot**
  - Start with 10 Lightning cards
  - Monitor success rate
  - Measure actual costs and speed
  - Gather user feedback
  - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours + monitoring time

---

## Phase 4: Lightning-First Redemption - Month 5

**Goal:** Default to Lightning redemption with on-chain fallback for maximum adoption

**Strategy:** 90% Lightning (instant, €0.001) + 10% on-chain (30 min, €0.50)
**User Compatibility Analysis (2026):**
- Lightning wallets: Phoenix, Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, BlueWallet (~40% of users)
- Exchange wallets: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken (support Lightning withdrawals only)
- Hardware wallets: Ledger, Trezor (on-chain only) (~20% of users)
- **Reality:** Most users CAN receive Lightning, but many prefer familiar on-chain

### 4.1 Database Schema Updates

- [x] **Move redemption fields to transactions table** ✅ Done
  ```sql
  -- Transactions table now tracks per-spend details:
  -- redemption_method TEXT NULL     — 'lightning' or 'onchain' (per transaction)
  -- payment_hash VARCHAR(64) NULL   — Lightning payment identifier
  -- payment_preimage VARCHAR(64) NULL — Lightning proof of payment
  -- lightning_invoice TEXT NULL      — BOLT11 invoice string
  -- tx_hash VARCHAR(64) NULL        — On-chain tx hash (existing)
  ```
  - Each spend creates a new transaction with its own method
  - Cards support partial spends (multiple redeems until balance = 0)
  - `btc_amount_sats` on Card = remaining balance (decremented per spend)

### 4.2 Redemption API Updates

- [x] **Update `POST /api/cards/{id}/redeem` endpoint** ✅ Done (business logic)
  - `RedeemCard(ctx, req)` accepts method (`lightning`/`onchain`), invoice/address, amount_sats
  - Partial spend support: amount_sats can be less than card balance
  - Creates Transaction record with redemption_method + Lightning or on-chain fields
  - Deducts amount_sats from card's btc_amount_sats
  - Card stays `Active` until balance = 0, then becomes `Redeemed`
  - Validates Lightning invoice amount and on-chain address (wallet.ValidateAddress)
  - 8-step orchestrator: validate → lock → check card → pay → record tx → update balance → publish monitor
  - ⚠️ **HTTP handler not yet wired** — business logic exists but no route serves it

- [x] **Implement dual redemption worker** ✅ Done (in Service, not separate worker)
  - `executePayment()` dispatches to `executeLightningPayment()` or `executeOnChainPayment()`
  - **Lightning path:** `lndClient.PayInvoice()` (SendPaymentV2 streaming, maxFeeSats from config)
  - **On-chain path:** `lndClient.SendOnChain()` (targetConf from config, minOnChainAmountSats=10000)
  - `publishMonitorTransaction()` sends `MonitorTransactionMessage` to `"monitor_tx"` stream
  - PaymentResult.Status checked for Succeeded/Failed/InFlight
  - ⚠️ **monitor_tx consumer worker not yet created**

### 4.3 User Experience - Lightning First

- [ ] **Smart redemption UI with Lightning default**
  - **Default:** Lightning option selected (instant, free)
  - **Alternative:** "Use standard Bitcoin address instead" link (slower, €0.50 fee)
  - Show clear benefits: "⚡ Instant & FREE" vs "🐌 30 min wait + €0.50 fee"
  - QR code generation for Lightning invoices
  - Address validation with real-time feedback
  - **Psychology:** Make Lightning the path of least resistance
  - **Estimated effort:** 10-12 hours

- [ ] **Lightning onboarding flow**
  - Detect if user has Lightning wallet (paste invoice vs address)
  - Recommend Lightning wallets if on-chain chosen: Phoenix (easiest), Muun, Wallet of Satoshi
  - "Try Lightning - Get your BTC instantly!" banner
  - Educational tooltip: "Lightning = Same Bitcoin, instant delivery, no fees"
  - Track redemption method choices (measure Lightning adoption)
  - **Goal:** Push 90%+ to Lightning through UX, not force
  - **Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

- [ ] **"Don't redeem, spend it!" teaser (pre-Phase 5)**
  - After redemption, show: "Coming soon: Spend your gift card directly at merchants ⚡"
  - Email capture for waitlist: "Be first to spend BTC at your favorite stores"
  - Track interest level (measure demand for payment features)
  - **Purpose:** Educate users that Lightning = payments, not just transfers
  - **Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

---

## Phase 5: Merchant Payments - Month 6-8

**Goal:** Transform gift cards from a transfer tool into a **payment instrument**

> Instead of: Buy card → Redeem to wallet → Send to merchant  
> We enable: Buy card → **Pay merchant directly** from card balance

**Why this matters:**
- Users keep BTC in our ecosystem (longer retention, more revenue)
- Every payment = a fee opportunity (1-2% merchant fee)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Lightning Network Complexity**
  - Mitigation: Start on testnet, pilot with 10 cards, gradual rollout
  - Fallback: Keep on-chain system as backup

- **Channel Liquidity Issues**
  - Mitigation: Monitor daily, set up automated alerts, maintain hot wallet
  - Fallback: On-chain funding if Lightning fails

- **LND Node Downtime**
  - Mitigation: Hot standby node, automated failover, health checks
  - Fallback: Queue cards until node recovers

### Business Risks

- **Low Volume (Treasury Overinvestment)**
  - Mitigation: Start with €5K treasury, scale based on demand
  - Trigger: Refill only when processing >50 cards/week

- **OTC Provider Delays**
  - Mitigation: 2-3 business day buffer in treasury
  - Minimum treasury: 1 week of expected volume

- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - Mitigation: Consult with crypto-friendly legal advisor
  - KYC/AML: Implement if volume exceeds regulatory thresholds

## Decision Points

### Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Lightning Migration Timeline**
   - ⏳ Decision: Proceed with Phase 3 (Month 3-4) or stay on-chain indefinitely?
   - **Recommendation:** Migrate after 500 successful on-chain cards
   - **Criteria:** Revenue > €2,500, operational stability, team capacity

2. **Bank Transfer Provider**
   - ⏳ Decision: Qonto vs Revolut Business vs Wise Business vs bunq?
   - **Recommendation:** Qonto (French-regulated, API on all plans, fully automated SEPA to trusted beneficiaries, instant SEPA by default)
   - See **Appendix A** below for full comparison
   - **Criteria:** Webhook/notification support, API quality, SCA automation, monthly fees, SEPA instant support

3. **Redemption Strategy**
   - ⏳ Decision: Lightning-only or Lightning-first with on-chain fallback?
   - **Recommendation:** Lightning-first hybrid (reach 100% of users, push 85-90% to Lightning through UX)
   - **Why not Lightning-only?** Would exclude 20-40% of potential customers (exchange-only users, hardware wallets)
   - **Why not equal treatment?** Lightning is objectively better (instant, free) - make it the default
   - **Criteria:** Adoption metrics (track % choosing Lightning), customer feedback

4. **OTC Provider Selection**
   - ⏳ Decision: Crypto.com OTC vs Kraken OTC vs Binance OTC?
   - **Recommendation:** Crypto.com OTC (fully automatable API, RFQ flow, sandbox available)
   - **Comparison:**

     | Feature | Crypto.com OTC 2.0 | Kraken OTC | Binance OTC |
     |---------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
     | API automation | ✅ Full RFQ → Deal flow | ❌ Contact desk | ⚠️ Limited |
     | BTC withdrawal API | ✅ `create-withdrawal` | ✅ API available | ✅ API available |
     | Fiat deposit API | ❌ Must wire from bank | ❌ Must wire from bank | ❌ Must wire from bank |
     | Fiat deposit methods | SEPA, SWIFT, Fedwire, UK FPS | SEPA, SWIFT | SEPA, SWIFT |
     | Sandbox/UAT | ✅ `uat-api.3ona.co` | ❌ No sandbox | ❌ No sandbox |
     | Auth method | HMAC-SHA256 | API key + nonce | HMAC-SHA256 |
     | Quote validity | ~10 seconds | Manual negotiation | Varies |
     | EU compliance | ✅ Licensed | ✅ Licensed | ⚠️ Regulatory pressure |

## Architecture Summary: Custodial Model

### How It Works

**Cards are custodial balance claims, NOT individual wallets:**
fast, cheap redemptions - DEFAULT path)
   - Hot wallet: 10-20% on-chain (for users who need on-chain - FALLBACK path)
2. **Cards are database entries** - Each card has a `balance_sats` field representing their claim
3. **No wallet per card** - We don't generate addresses or private keys for cards
4. **BTC transfers only on redemption:**
   - **Lightning redemption (90% of users):** Pay from Lightning channel balance (instant, €0.001)
   - **On-chain redemption (10% of users):** Send from hot wallet (30 min, €0.50)
   
**Market Reality (2026):**
- Lightning adoption growing but not universal (~40-60% have Lightning wallet capability)
- Exchanges support Lightning withdrawals but users still often deposit to exchange wallets
- Hardware wallet users (security-conscious) prefer on-chain
- **Solution:** Make Lightning the easy path, keep on-chain available
   - Lightning redemption → Pay from Lightning channel balance
   - On-chain redemption → Send from hot wallet

**Card Creation = Accounting, NOT Transaction:**
- User pays €100 → Card created with balance 0.0019 BTC
- No Bitcoin movement yet
- BTC stays in our Lightning channels/hot wallet
- Card is a promise to pay that amount later

**Card Redemption = Actual Bitcoin Transfer:**
- User provides Lightning invoice → We pay from our Lightning channel (instant, €0.001)
- User provides on-chain address → We send from hot wallet (30 min, €0.50)
- Card balance set to 0, marked as redeemed

**Treasury Balance Formula:**
```
Total Treasury = On-Chain + Lightning Channels
Available Balance = Total - Sum(Unredeemed Card Balances)
```

Example:
- Total Treasury: 2 BTC
- Unredeemed cards: 100 cards × 0.0019 BTC = 0.19 BTC
- Available: 2 - 0.19 = 1.81 BTC (can create more cards)

### Automation Path for Treasury Refill

**Qonto (Recommended):**
1. One-time: Trust Crypto.com's SEPA beneficiary details → No SCA required for future transfers
2. `POST /v2/external_transfers` with Crypto.com IBAN + amount + idempotency key
3. Instant SEPA (arrives in seconds-minutes) → Crypto.com detects deposit
4. **Result:** Fully automated fiat-to-exchange pipeline, no human intervention

**Revolut Business:**
1. Create counterparty: `POST /counterparty` with Crypto.com bank details
2. `POST /pay` with `account_id`, `receiver.counterparty_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `reference`
3. Webhook notification on `TransactionStateChanged` for confirmation
4. **Result:** Fully automated, but requires Company plan (€25+/month)

**Wise Business:**
1. Create recipient: `POST /v1/accounts` with Crypto.com bank details
2. Create quote: `POST /v3/profiles/{id}/quotes` (sourceAmount, EUR→EUR)
3. Create transfer: `POST /v1/transfers` with quote + recipient
4. Fund transfer: `POST /v3/profiles/{id}/transfers/{id}/payments` (type: BALANCE)
5. Track: Subscribe to `transfers#state-change` webhook
6. **Result:** Fully automated but 4-step flow, best for multi-currency (EUR→USD, GBP→EUR)

**bunq:**
1. Create payment: `POST /v1/user/{id}/monetary-account/{id}/payment`
2. Webhook via `notification-filter-url` with `PAYMENT` category
3. **Result:** Fully automated, simple API, but Dutch banking license (strong regulation)

### Recommendation

**Primary: Qonto** — Best for our use case because:
- ✅ Trusted beneficiary = fully automated transfers without SCA (critical for automation)
- ✅ SEPA instant by default (fastest fiat delivery to Crypto.com)
- ✅ API on all plans (no premium plan required for API access)
- ✅ French-regulated (ACPR) — strong EU compliance
- ✅ Batch transfers up to 400 (useful for refunds)
- ✅ Idempotency support (safe retries)
- ⚠️ EUR-focused (fine for EU-based business)

**Secondary: Revolut Business** (if multi-currency needed or already using Revolut):
- ✅ 30+ currencies, good webhook support
- ⚠️ Requires Company plan for API payments (€25+/month)

**Tertiary: Wise Business** (if sending to non-SEPA destinations):
- ✅ Best FX rates, 50+ currencies
- ✅ Ideal if treasury refill involves USD/GBP conversion
- ⚠️ More complex 4-step transfer flow

## Notes

- This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and market conditions
- Prioritize user experience and security over speed of implementation
- Test thoroughly on testnet before any mainnet deployment
- Keep detailed logs of all treasury transactions for accounting
- Stay updated on regulatory requirements for crypto businesses in your jurisdiction
- **Strategic priority:** Every decision should move users toward Lightning Network adoption
- **North star metric:** % of cards used for payments (not just one-time redemption)
- Gift cards are the entry point — Lightning payments are the destination

---

**Next Actions:**
1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Make decision on Lightning migration timeline
3. Choose bank transfer provider (Qonto recommended — see Appendix A)
4. Choose OTC provider (Crypto.com recommended — see Decision Point #4)
5. Set up business bank account + Crypto.com Exchange account
6. Test automation pipeline in sandboxes (Qonto staging + Crypto.com UAT)
7. Begin Phase 1 implementation
8. Research merchant payment regulations (payment license requirements)
9. Identify 5-10 pilot merchants for Phase 5 (crypto-friendly businesses)
